OrmerodWebControl
=================

Web Control Interface for the RepRapPro Ormerod

reprap.remote.htm - script links point to external CDN's, NO editing required, just rename to reprap.htm and copy to "www" directory on your Ormerod's Duet SD card.

reprap.remote.min.htm - (recommended) same as above but minified. rename to reprap.htm to use.



** Below instruction are only for Local Webserver installs. **

reprap.htm - script src's and link ref's need changing see below, must reside on the Ormerod's Duet SD card this is the only file served by the on board (duet) web server.
reprep.local.htm - same as above but minified (much harder to change script src's and link ref's), rename to reprap.htm to use.

favicon.ico
js (dir)
img(dir)
fonts(dir)
css(dir)

All of the above should be stored on a web server local to you.

1. before copying reprap.htm to the SD card edit it and change all link href locations (top of file) and script src locations (end of file) to point to where they reside on your local webserver, you can "find and replace" anything beginning with "http://192.168.1.2/reprap".

Dont forget this is an early Beta release, some features are missing, some may not work, I recommend you keep a close eye on your Ormerod while operating it via this interface as it has not been fully tested yet.
